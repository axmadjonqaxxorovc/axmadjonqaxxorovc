# Hi, I'm Qaxxorov! 👋



## 🚀 About Me
🐍 I'm a Python Developer...
I'm a passionate learner stepping into the world of code, one line at a time.
I work mostly with Python, diving into Django for web development, and building Telegram bots using Aiogram.
I'm also learning HTML and CSS to make things not just work — but look beautiful too.

Though I'm still growing, I'm focused, curious, and always ready to build something new.
Whether it's solving bugs or launching bots, I do it with a smile 😄
